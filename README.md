The computer has a two-step learning system: student and teacher.
The teacher learns all possible games,
which makes its think long when it makes moves.
The student learns from the teacher,
and this training is more effective,
since the student already plays with an experienced opponent,
so the studentâ€™s experience will be less, but better,
which will allow its to think faster when playing with a person.
